# Sign-Language-Detection
This project is a real-time sign language detection system that recognizes hand gestures corresponding to sign language alphabets/words using computer vision and machine learning techniques. It leverages a webcam to capture hand gestures and processes them using a custom-trained model (e.g., CNN) to predict the corresponding sign.
