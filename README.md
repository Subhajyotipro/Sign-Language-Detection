#  Sign Language Detection System

A **real-time sign language detection system** that recognizes hand gestures corresponding to sign language alphabets or words using **computer vision** and **deep learning**.  
This project aims to **bridge communication gaps** between deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals and others.

##  Features
- Real-time hand gesture recognition via webcam  
- Detects multiple sign language alphabets or words  
- User-friendly interface for live detection  
- Can be extended to full sentence formation  
- Provides visual feedback for detected gestures

##  Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**  
- **OpenCV** – Image & video processing  
- **MediaPipe / cvzone** – Hand tracking and landmark detection  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Deep learning model for gesture recognition  
- **NumPy / Pandas** – Data handling and preprocessing
